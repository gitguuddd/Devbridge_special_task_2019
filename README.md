# Devbridge_special_task_2019

## Wall of fame
- Program takes in a decimal number of any size 
- Program checks if input with one leading zero is a cyclic number, because most of cyclic numbers start with one leading zero
- Program checks if input is numeral only

## Wall tile of shame

- Because the task was done in a rush, the program could be more simplified by removal of redundant code
- Some inputs for e.g 000000000 will be seen as invalid by input validation function even though the input is fine itself.
